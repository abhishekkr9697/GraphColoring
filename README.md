# Graph Coloring
This is the code for my **Graph Coloring Exploration Project**, which at first was my Artificial Intelligence course project at *Amirkabir University of Technology* (aka *AUT* or *Tehran Polytechnic*).
After a while, I modified it so it becomes a comprehensive, juicy project!
### Goal
The goal of this project is to implement and compare some of the famous Heuristic algorithms and AI approaches to Graph Coloring problem.
### [NEW!]
I wrote a Python script to extract the adjacency matrix of graphs in .col format from [here](https://mat.tepper.cmu.edu/COLOR/instances/instances.tar).
Handled .col.b files as well by chance! (drag and drop in the compiled C code)

### Story of Implementation
Just like almost any other code I try to write, I faced many problems to prepare the contents of this repository.
And I would like to tell that story, as it might be helpful for some people.

* **Code**
- More on the way later!

* **Data Collection**
- drag and drop into a.exe
- get code out of shar file on site
- concatenation of datasets, and correction with "index=True" in to_csv
- 

### TO ADD
* More graphs
* affiliation of each graph and source
